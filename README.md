## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js installed.

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the CLI tool using:

```sh
node cli.js <command> [options]
```

### Register Devices

Register multiple devices with sensors:

```sh
node cli.js register-devices "car=2,truck=2"
```

This registers two cars and two trucks, mapping sensors automatically.

### Delete a Device

Deletes a registered device by ID:

```sh
node cli.js delete-device 8
```

### Update Sensor

Update the type and/or unit of a sensor:

```sh
node cli.js update-sensor -i 1 -t "temperature" -u "Â°C"
```

At least one of `--type` or `--unit` is required.

### Simulate Sensor Readings

Simulate readings for specific devices:

```sh
node cli.js simulate-readings-for-devices 1,2
```

Options:
- `--no-mapping-cache`: Fetch fresh mappings instead of using cached ones.
- `--no-validate-mappings`: Skip validation of sensor mappings.
- `--no-response-body`: Suppress response body from the server.

## Configuring Log Levels

Log levels can be configured to control output verbosity. Set the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to one of the following:

- `error`: Show only errors.
- `warn`: Show warnings and errors.
- `info`: Default level, shows general logs.
- `debug`: Show detailed logs for debugging.

Example:

```sh
LOG_LEVEL=debug node cli.js register-devices "car=1"
```

## API Configuration

Ensure your `.env` file is set up with:

```sh
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/acme
```
